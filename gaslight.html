    <p><em><strong>Has someone in your life ever caused you to isolate yourself?</em>
                <br><br>
                <em>Have you ever felt as if you are losing your mind because of being told that your memory is faulty?</strong></em>
    </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">While searching for your sanity, you only find comfort when alone because confusion and fear of others
                seem to be taking over your reality.   For some reason, you have begun to feel the need to examine why
                you exist, making you feel as if you should give up because nothing you do or say is right.  Your memory
                also seems to be failing because you do not remember what you have said, things you have done, or places
                you have recently visited. You are being brainwashed to believe that how you see events is not how
                everyone else views them.  You are convinced that you are becoming insane because your reality is not the same as others.
    </p>
        <h3><em>Could you be going through a gaslighting campaign conducted by an animal you once loved?</em></h3>
        <h3>Abusers use gaslighting campaigns to force their victims to question:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Whether they are the abusers</li>
        <li>Whether they are the cause of everything that is going wrong in their abusers’ lives</li>
        <li>If they are causing their abuser to need to abuse them</li>
        <li>Why do their lives seem to be on display for the world to view</li>
        <li>Their ability to be around other people and become a part of healthy relationships becomes almost impossible</li>
        <li>Whether they should give up and commit suicide</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Often, during gaslighting campaigns:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Abusers call the police to arrest their victims for crimes that they actually committed. Have you ever been
            punished for a crime you did not commit? </li>
        <li>Have you ever lost your children for offenses that you never committed or tried to convince professionals
            that you were not the abuser?</li>
        <li>Narcissistic abusers get away with ruining lives with lies.</li>
        <li>Narcissistic abusers make you believe you are the one telling lies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">While you know and tell the truth, a gaslighting campaign conductor manipulates your
        mind and their worshippers into thinking that you cannot speak the truth.  Between the brainwashing, isolation,
        and lies, you feel as if you don’t deserve to exist because of the unbearable confusion regarding what you know
        is right and what you are being told is correct.  This feeling of bewilderment accompanies most gaslighting campaigns.
    </p>
    <h3><em>What is gaslighting, and why does it hurt?</em></h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><strong>Gaslighting</strong> is a method of abuse used by many abusers to control you.
        It is an abusive action that causes an individual to question what they do or say, which initiates horrible
        feelings of confusion. Victims often become dependent on the person manipulating their mind because they lose
        trust in their ability to make sound decisions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Often victims develop a dependence on the abuser during a gaslighting campaign because
        they feel incapable of coping without their assistance.  The victim becomes blind to the fact that they are
        being manipulated, which also explains the Stockholm Theory that states that often victims will become attached
        to their abuser.  If a person feels as if they are incapable of making decisions and taking care of themselves,
        they tend to become dependent on their so-called caregiver.  If your abuser is providing for you while abusing
        you, then it is normal to convince yourself they care and that you cannot make it without them.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">No matter what you think is right, your abuser uses gaslighting to convince you that
        you are wrong.  <strong>Gaslighting</strong> is a form of psychological abuse that causes you to question
        everything about your existence.  Often victims and survivors of gaslighting campaigns isolate themselves out of
        shame because they become brainwashed to believe that their abuser’s words are the reality and that they are to
        blame for the abuse inflicted by their abuser.  Furthermore, victims of gaslighting tend to isolate themselves
        because their abuser spreads their negative thoughts about their victims to anyone who will listen.   Many
        victims resort to suicide because of the brainwashing, isolation, and loss of their self-trust.
    </p>
    <h3>How does gaslighting cause you to question your sanity?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your abuser tells you and others blatant lies about you.</li>
        <li>Your abuser denies you said whatever you may have because you disagreed with them.</li>
        <li>Your abuser denies all your accusations and projects them onto you. </li>
        <li>Your abuser may break or take your belongings while valuing their items as if they are treasures. </li>
        <li>Your abuser takes credit for the good things that you do.</li>
        <li>Your abuser ruins your spirit by making you think that you cannot do or say anything right.</li>
        <li>Your abuser uses statements, gifts, and periods of lavish treatment to control and confuse you into worshipping them.</li>
        <li>Your abuser isolates you.</li>
        <li>Your abuser works to convince you that other people are lying to you.  Especially if they threaten to reveal your abuser’s true motives.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gaslighting causes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You to mistrust yourself.</li>
        <li>You become afraid of others because of your loss of self-esteem.</li>
        <li>You feel frightened of others.</li>
        <li>You feel vulnerable to abuse of all types.</li>
        <li>You feel that you are not able to label when someone is abusive.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Your life and spirit become lost in their gaslighting campaign.</em></h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">You can fight a gaslighting campaign by learning when you are the victim of one of
        the worst forms of abuse because it is the manipulation of one’s mind.
    </p>
    <h3>How to know when you are part of a gaslighting campaign:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your abuser has no care or time to hear about your concerns.</li>
        <li>Your abuser accuses you of not making sense when you speak.</li>
        <li>Your abuser says that you imagined different events.</li>
        <li>Your abuser denies doing or saying things.</li>
        <li>Your abuser makes out that your concerns are trivial by accusing you of overreacting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to prove a gaslighting campaign and keep your sanity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a journal of all the events of the instances of abuse.</li>
        <li>Record all voice interchanges between you and your abuser. </li>
        <li>Take pictures of the events.  Often, a hidden camera is valuable because it can run 24/7 to record those
            times when your abuser may be talking behind your back.</li>
        <li>Keeping your journal and all recordings in a private email account is a good idea.</li>
        <li>It helps to seek support groups, therapy, or life coaching, which will help you understand your reaction to
            the gaslighting and how to live free of your abuser.  When seeking assistance, look for individuals with
            trauma experience in their backgrounds. </li>
        <li>Resist the urge to argue with your abuser because they will use your actions to make you look crazy.</li>
        <li>Remember that nothing your say will change your abuser’s mind. </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Even if you figure out that you are the victim of gaslighting late into a relationship
        or life, let yourself become free.  Never forget that you are not the ugly person that they want you to believe
        you are.  No matter how many people believe their accusations, let yourself trust yourself again.  Remember, a
        Narcissist’s worst enemy and the reason they conducted the gaslighting campaign.  Even the worst of narcissists
        can be beaten in their own game.  The more you love yourself enough to tell the truth, the faster their world
        crumbles.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Keep your boundaries, learn as much as you can about narcissists and how to cope with
        them before and after leaving, and you will soon find happiness.  Never give up.
