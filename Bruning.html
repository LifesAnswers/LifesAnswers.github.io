<p><strong><h2>Michigan Family Court refuses girl's cries for help</h2></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Since the party's divorce on December 23, 2015, Sophia Bruning, now 11 years old, has attempted suicide 3 times in the last 6 months while in the care of her mother.  The attempts, as stated by Sophia, are 
    the result of no one caring about helping her.  She is giving up on anyone involved with Child Protection Services (CPS) in Michigan (MI) helping her because they have ignored her cries for help for eight 
    years.  Her cries of abuse that have not been investigated by the Michigan Department of Children and Families (MDHHS) include her telling psychologists, school counselors, teachers, other students, parents, 
    judges, etc.,.  Resulting from pressure placed on MDHHS by State representatives, CPS has finally sent Mr. Bruning nine years of reports that prove that abuse has been documented since 2015, and the child 
    should have been removed from the mother’s home years ago.  Everything said by us in this letter and the video are backed by the CPS reports between 2015-2023.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    During my latest meeting (6/21/23) with the minor child, she stated that she had told MDHHS case workers and law enforcement that she experiences daily emotional and physical abuse inflicted upon her by her 
    mother and stepfather.  She has reported that guns and ammunition are readily available to her at home.  She stated that her Stepfather drinks with Sergeant McKenzie, who her Stepfather enlists to threaten 
    her when she speaks of the abuse, while the MDHHS caseworkers verbally lie, stating that she does not tell them about what she is going through.  The reports from CPS reflect the truth that the child has 
    revealed the abuse to the MDHHS caseworkers since 2015. The Mother’s attorney, Denise M. Burke and Sgt. McKenzie have both threatened her with going to a Juvenile Detention Center if she should continue to 
    talk about the abuse she is experiencing. Her psychiatrist stated that the medication is not helping her as much as it should because her depression is not physically triggered; it is situational, stemming 
    from the environment that MDHHS is forcing her, Judge Mack (Now Judge Black), and law enforcement to endure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    On June 6, 2023, after being told by Arron Rabbage with MDHHS that the case had been investigated.  The Father is left to assume that the results showed that the claims regarding the child were again 
    unfounded because, after numerous requests, he has not received a written report regarding their findings.  Today, when he finally received the reports, the father learned that the MDHHS has noted that the 
    child has been abused by her mother and Stepfather. Furthermore, Mr. Rabbage stated, with Mr. Bruning (the biological father) on the phone, that it should be apparent from the many previously unfounded 
    reports that the child was safe.  Mr. Rabbage lied, as noted by the 9 years of MDHHS reports documenting abuse.  According to the MDHHS reports, the child has revealed the fact that she is also being abused 
    by practitioners and MDHHS employees outside of her immediate family.  The child is seeking help because of being trapped by MDHHS and the MI Family Court in a situation where she sees her only escape from 
    the daily abuse is harming herself or committing suicide.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Ms. Jessica Carls, Intake Analyst with the Office of Children Ombudsman (OCO) noted that my claim of Mr. Rabbage lying and inability to state why they considered the child safe was not the responsibility of 
    the OCO to investigate.  I was misquoted, possibly purposely, by Ms. Carls when I stated that I wanted a fair investigation of the abuse Sophia is going through and reporting.  I stated, “Please investigate 
    the case because I do not want Sophia to become one of the thousands of children who die in MI because of a lack of MDHHS intervention.”  Ms. Carls refused an investigation performed by OCO.  I tried to clarify 
    that I was not complaining about individual employee issues, I wanted a child’s safety to be ensured.  I also shared that the number of abused children continues to increase in MI, and OCO was possibly 
    contributing because of misinterpretations of complaints.  Again, Ms. Carls of OCO stated that they were not responsible and could and would not investigate the case.  Apparently, refusal of investigation did 
    not occur by MDHHS, they found abuse since 2015, but have left the child in the dangerous situation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    The OCO notes what type of complaints they are seeking.  The description from their website shows that my request was within my right to ask from the MI OCO because Sophia represented the type of child abuse 
    being ignored by MDHHS.  The reports note neglect by MDHHS, which is possibly why MI OCO does not want to investigate.  They might find that someone within the MDHHS system made a life-threatening mistake.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    As stated on the MI OCO website, If you believe that your experience with Michigan's child welfare system, CPS, foster care, adoption, and/or juvenile justice) can highlight a system-wide issue or deficiency or 
    can be used as a case sample to improve the child welfare system as a whole; please contact our office or file an online complaint.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    NOTE: Mr. Bruning and I are asking that the OCO offer assistance with our case to begin lowering the growing number of youths that die from mishandled MDHHS investigations of reported child abuse.  Too many 
    youths in MI are dying, resulting from MDHHS ignoring their cries.  Some of the growing numbers of dying children in MI are committing suicide, while others are dying of horrendous beatings or by readily available firearms.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    MDHHS’s improper investigation of child-reported trauma is responsible for approximately 1/3 of MI’s growing number of youth suicides annually.  Sadly, the youth suicide rate in MI has been increasing by 
    approximately 25% yearly since 2000.  Could refusals for assistance from those in positions of authority with MDHHS and the OCO be contributing to the horrendous increase in youth suicides in MI? The answers 
    offered by MDHHS and OCO representatives were routine and followed by requests for our concerns to be forwarded to unconcerned staff members of MDHHS, who are probably going to ignore our seeking assistance until the 
    child possibly takes the case into her own hands and commits suicide to rid herself of the pain.   Even though she continues to report the abuse while being threatened by the perpetrators.  No one listens.  Could the 
    state be protecting an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), who is a gun shop owner who blatantly emotionally and physically abuses Sophia while interfering with all forms of visitation with her father? </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Sophia has also reported being afraid of her Stepfather when her mother forced her to be alone with him both in the car and at home while he was drunk.  MDHHS reported that the Stepfather threatened the child with a gun.  
    Child abuse researchers note that if a child speaks of experiencing abuse, there is approximately a 90% chance that it is occurring.   These child abuse researchers state that listening to children is important because 
    additional harm could be inflicted on the child, or the minor could begin to harm themselves and develop suicidal ideations.  Sophia began by cutting herself to block the pain.  Now, she attempts suicide when she is in 
    the care of her mother and Stepfather.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    MDHHS ignores the fact that guns are readily available to this suicidal child in her home. The popular EMT owns a local gun shop (Sunrise Firearms & Tactical Equipment).  Sophia often talks about guns being in their home 
    as openly as being on the kitchen table for a 2-year-old to find.  Should MDHHS investigators, supervisors, and OCO continue to ignore claims of children in need of assistance who experience trauma, have firearms in their 
    homes, and prove to have suicidal ideations?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    These statistics reported by the National Violent Death Reporting System (MVDRS)show that suicide and firearm accidents are the top reasons for deaths in youth ages 5-11 in MI.  Sophia is now 11 years old with a family 
    history of suicide attempts by her mother while living in a home with firearms, drugs, and alcoholism.   MVDRS also indicates that the number one form of youth suicide is hanging or suffocation occurring within their homes.  
    A little above 40% of reported abuse cases ended in suicide per lack of investigation by MDHHS or custody being ruled to the abuser by a Judge in MI Family Court.  The inconsistency of the Judge’s response to the Father’s 
    plea to save his child showed that there is either corruption, ignorance, or both in the MI legal system assuring safety for the youth in their state.   In MI, alone, 1-4 youth suicides were performed by children as young 
    as 5 attempting to report their history of trauma to their local law enforcement, MDHHS, or Family Court.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    This minor child’s cries are being ignored in Mi by Law Enforcement, MDHHS, school counselor, principal, teachers, State Representatives, and various agencies the MI Government provides to assist abused children.  An MI 
    Attorney General’s (AG) aid informed me that the only way to acquire assistance for the crime of child abuse is to seek law enforcement or report the claim to the MDHHS.  I was offered the information that the state AG 
    only assisted child support cases.  I learned from the aid employed at the AG office that they were in no way responsible for mishandling child abuse MDHHS reports involving the crime of child abuse.  In reading this 
    definition offered by the State of MI, one would assume that if a MDHHS employee mishandles an investigation or offers lies to the caregivers, the AG can in fact intervene, and it is the AG’s responsibility to ensure the 
    safety of the public.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    AG Duties Noted by the State of MI: 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    The Attorney General is the state's top lawyer and law enforcement official, protecting and serving the people and interests of Michigan through a broad range of duties. The Attorney General's responsibilities include 
    safeguarding the public from violent criminals, helping victims of crime, leading the fight against human trafficking and opioid abuse, preserving Michigan's spectacular natural resources, protecting consumers, and 
    addressing illegal business practices.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    NOTE:  First, the OCO asks for reports regarding MDHHS mishandling of cases while refusing to investigate the case that could begin the process of reducing the climbing youth death rate in MI.  Then the AG refuses to 
    assist a youth experiencing the crime of child abuse.  No wonder the MI Government was voted the most corrupt in the US in 2019.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Mr. Bruning and I are asking that anyone or organizations with the means to assist in ensuring Sophia’s safety offer an honest hand of assistance.  Our goal is to save this minor child before 
    her abusers murder her or she commits suicide because she feels that is the only way she can escape the abuse. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">Please ensure that what is best for this minor child occurs.</p>
