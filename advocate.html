    <h3>Have you ever sounded like this when you sought help?</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><strong>“HELL I don’t know, but NO ONE WILL HELP…….. I’ve tried and tried; I even have a
            Protective Order. SO WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO…And what is going to happen to me?”… </strong>The police refused to arrest this woman’s violent
            husband because they did not see him hurt her.  Rarely is abuse seen by police, which sends victims seeking
            additional help, if they live to tell since immediate law enforcement assistance is almost impossible to
            obtain.  Of course, this woman’s abuser increased his actions until she escaped to her nearest Emergency
            Room (ER), thankfully, alive.  Disfigured a bit, but alive.  Approximately 1-2 people die per day in
            domestic violence disputes.
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Whether your situation involves a doctor, corporation, legal system, your abuser,
            institution, or mental health practitioner, etc…I help you, as your <strong>Legal Advocate</strong>, reach the right sources
            to accomplish your goal of filing a complaint, charges, need a legal decision amended, or you are involved
            in a messy divorce/custody/Child Protection Services (CPS) battle.  Often victims and survivors need
            assistance finding needed protection, punishing, or acquiring restitution for injuries caused by an abuser
            or Social Services (SS).  Attorneys are only able to take your complaint to Court, which only seems to
            extend the pain of the abuse being ignored.
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">An advocate helps you find assistance, understand your case, works with your
            attorney or you if you are pro se, and continues with you after you have exhausted what you can accomplish
            with motions.  Very often a motion is not enough.  I continue with your case through complaints within your
            State or Federal.  No matter what is takes to win your case, I can assist, no matter where you are.  Advocates are not held by
            licenses.  For that reason there is no limit to what an Advocate can do for you.
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><strong>As a Legal Advocate for domestic violence or general abuse victims</strong>, I have helped
            to convict abusers of attempt of murder and keeping children with their proper parents in CPS. I have
            assisted in causing prosecuting attorney who worked in a DA’s office to be sentenced to Federal Jails.  As
            part of one of my investigations, I unleashed a huge human trafficking ring that is still under investigation.
            On a consistent basis I am winning cases and sending children to their safe homes when their parents had lost hope.
            I understand the needs of trauma victims or alienated parents due to having been a survivor of domestic
            violence as a child and as an adult.
            </p>
        <h3>As survivors, we need to learn that walking away does not have to include losing everything to our abuser.</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Think of fighting for your rights this way, every time an abuser, corporation,
            institution, law enforcement, or mental health practitioner suffers punishment for abusive actions; we come
            that much closer to ending abuse.  Criminal activity and abuse of innocent people multiplies if the cowards
            committing the acts know that only their victim suffers.  As a corruption analyst, I show corruption in
            cases when others would walk away.  I fear no one when I deliver the message in Court as your expert witness.
        </p>

            <h3>Have you ever been mistreated like this by your therapist?</h3><br>
        <h3>System abuse increases your chances of developing PTSD</h3>
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">When suffering from System Abuse, your symptoms resemble those that you exhibited while a victim.  It is a form
        of PTSD known as System Abuse Syndrome.  Sufferers of System Abuse Syndrome find that they fear going anywhere,
        calling for help, and being alone.  Many system survivors have said that you become a bundle of mixed feelings
        and fear that builds into extreme anxiety, known as <a href="https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/agoraphobia#1" style="font-size: 1em">agoraphobia</a>, which is a fear of going anywhere.  An advocate
        with psychological training is an unbeatable Life Coach as your support system when you are attempting to win a
        case against a narcissist while still in recovery.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Often System Abuse Syndrome survivors, have panic attacks, become ill if they
            enter a courtroom, or see a police officer.  The same is true for those that are abused by institutions and
            corporations, which explains why a Legal Advocate can become your best friend.  Your Legal Advocate knows
            how to turn abuse into positive action to achieve your goal while protecting you from additional
            victimization by becoming your voice in communicating your cause, goal, or necessity. There is no limit to
            who an Advocate can contact or what I can do to work for your goal of winning your case because this person
            is not an attorney.
            </p>
        <h3>My Passion is helping people survive abuse!</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;"><strong>Abuse has no likes, dislikes, or prejudices</strong>.  No matter who you are, how old you
            are, where you live, how much money or education you have; abuse can become a part of your life.
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Whether you are being abused by a violent partner, corporation, institution, a
            doctor, or law enforcement, etc.  I have 35+ years of working experience, a Ph.D. in Public Safety, and am a
            survivor of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse as a child, domestic violence as an adult.
            </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">As your Legal Advocate, I am available as an abuse and corruption analyst and
            expert witness.
        </p>
