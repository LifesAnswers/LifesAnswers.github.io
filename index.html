<p>When suffering through a Child Protection Services (CPS) or a High Conflict Divorce case involving children,
finding the assistance you can trust is often the hardest.  When your children are being alienated,
and you are recovering from abuse, trusting anyone becomes almost impossible.  Because of the gaslighting,
you find that possibly your memories and opinions are also difficult to trust.
Yet, what you are sure of is that your children have been wrongfully taken from you and are changing while painfully abusing you.</p>

<p>As a survivor, I understand what the Legal System and your abuser are doing to you.
For example, reactionary abuse causes many targeted parents to lose their children to abusers because most Judges
are ignorant in knowing how to recognize when reactionary maltreatment occurs.  Or accusations are mistaken for Alienation Language.</p>

<p>I help you understand the emotional side of your case while assisting you with the legal end.  I am available as an
Expert Witness and to compile Case Assessments based on solid evidence, 35+ years of research, and a Ph.D. in Public
Safety.  My background as a published author, past broadcaster, and survivor has assisted in helping thousands of
families reunite.</p>

<h3>I am here for you whether you are struggling with a CPS and/or Parental Alienation case.</h3>

<p>No one will work harder for you because I understand what you are going through.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<h3 style="font-family: Brush Script MT">Dr. Sandra Speer, Ph.D., CLC, CDRC, Legal Advocate, & Survivor</h3>
