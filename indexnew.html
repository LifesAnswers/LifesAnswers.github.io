                    In a shocking revelation, the case of 11-year-old Sophia Bruning exposes the deep-rooted corruption 
                    within the Michigan Family Court system and the Michigan Department of Children & Families (MDHHS).
                    Despite nine years of documented abuse, including threats from her stepfather who owns a gun shop, 
                    MDHHS and corrupt judges have failed to protect Sophia, leaving her in an abusive environment. Her 
                    desperate cries for help, including several suicide attempts in the last year, have been ignored, 
                    raising serious questions about the integrity and accountability of those entrusted with safeguarding 
                    vulnerable children.

        Your contributions have been truly invaluable, and I'm grateful not only for the practical help you've provided 
        but also for the emotional boost you gave us. Your belief in us and our ability to win, despite the odds, gave 
        us the confidence to believe in ourselves and our case. You helped us feel seen and heard, and we're deeply 
        thankful for your help and encouragement throughout this journey. Iâ€™m really looking forward to seeing my kids 
        be reunited. My heart is so full and happy ðŸ’—

        Andersen Erick this is the same with the courts where I live. Better yet my attorney. I take that back, he's NOT 
        my attorney anymore, he doesn't advocate for my family. Dr. Speer does! She cares she will be your advocate and voice.
        Stay strong and like she said...love them love those children they see it and feel it.
        It was written in response to this:
        Andersen Erick
        The only ones that win are the courts an the programs that support them. I've had visitation ordered for 8yrs, still 
        haven't seen my child, the more I file the worse it gets, the courts try to silence you on what they are doing. I finally 
        gave up after I realized it's not about the child, it's about the adults that use the child to gain from, ask the judge
         if he would raise there kids in the same fashion they are putting your kids, the answer is no, they wouldn't">

      <img src="images/sarah.jpg" alt="I met Sandra Speer in November of 2021 during the start of my divorce.
      I found her through one of my domestic abuse groups. She has helped me tremendously through my divorce and
      custody battle. She is also very resourceful when asking about what you should do in a situation especially
      with a narcissist or sociopath. She is very knowledgeable and kind and I believe she really wants to help others.
      I truly believe I wouldn't have gotten as far as I have now without her help.  I truly believe that without her
      help, my 3-year-old son would have been awarded to my sex offending EX.

      <img src="images/bob.jpg" alt="Sandra Speer is possibly the most caring and knowledgeable Legal Advocate I have
      ever met.  My case is 10 years old and she has been the only one to make a difference.  She works non-stop until
      she sees a win for you.

      <img src="images/daniel.jpg" alt="My 6-year-old daughter was awarded to my EX who is an abuser and alcoholic.
      No one believed me when I would say that she beat me and my daughter because I am a big man.  I have to thank
      Sandra for helping me to gain the belief of now the authorities.  I truly believe that it is not going to be long
      before I have custody of my daughter with her assessment showing the abuse that my EX has performed.

      <img src="images/sabrina.jpg" alt="Until my very highly paid attorney read Sandraâ€™s abuse assessment of my case,
      he would not allow me to testify that I was going through a Parental Alienation case.  After reading her assessment,
      my attorney changed his strategy and today I am reunified with my son.  I have never been happier and looking
      forward to many wonderful times with my once alienated son thanks to Sandraâ€™s endless work on my case.

      <img src="images/johnathan.jpg" alt="Sandra Speer you are probably the most valued member of this entire Facebook
      group. So many of us fathers are experiencing this exact same situation. Glad to have you. In California its penal
      code 278.5 I believe and it's a crime to keep the children away from the other parent. The law even says filing
      custody after the fact as a defense is not acceptable for a defense. Or something along those lines. I wish this
      parent, and all parents who need it luck.
