        <p>Have you ever sounded like this when you sought help?
            “HELL I don’t know, but NO ONE WILL HELP…… I’ve tried and tried; I even have a Protective Order.
            SO WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO…And what is going to happen to me?”…
            The police refused to arrest this woman’s violent husband because they did not see him hurt her.
            Rarely is abuse seen by police, which sends victims seeking additional help, if they live to tell since
            immediate law enforcement assistance is almost impossible to obtain.  Of course, this woman’s abuser
            increased his actions until she escaped to her nearest Emergency Room (ER), thankfully, alive.  Disfigured a
            bit, but alive.  Approximately 1-2 people die per day in domestic violence disputes.

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.25em">By: Dr. Sandra Speer, Ph.D.</h3>
            <p><em>Has someone in your life ever caused you to isolate yourself?</em>
                <br><br>
                <em>Have you ever felt as if you are losing your mind because of being told that your memory is faulty?</em>
                <br><br>
                While searching for your sanity, you only find comfort when alone because confusion and fear of others
                seem to be taking over your reality.   For some reason, you have begun to feel the need to examine why
                you exist, making you feel as if you should give up because nothing you do or say is right.  Your memory
                also seems to be failing because you do not remember what you have said, things you have done, or places
                you have recently visited. You are being brainwashed to believe that how you see events is not how
                everyone else views them.  You are convinced that you are becoming insane because your reality is not the same as others.

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.25em">By: Dr. Sandra Speer, Ph.D.</h3>

            <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence" style="font-size: 1em">Domestic violence</a> occurs when an individual is emotionally, physically, or sexually abused, or
               threatened by an intimate partner.  What differentiates domestic abuse from child abuse is that when a
               child is involved, the offender does not need to be an intimate partner or an individual with whom they
               are related by blood...</p>
            <p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/fastfact.html" style="font-size: 1em">Globally</a>, 1-4 women and 1-10 men experience physical abuse during their lifetime with
               15% of those reported cases committed by intimate partners?  It is estimated that for each domestic
               violence case that is reported, ten domestic abuse incidents are not reported. Almost 50% of all female
                homicides, which occur in the United States involve...
