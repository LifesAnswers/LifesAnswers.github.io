      <img src="images/mandy.jpg" alt="I would just like to thank Sandra Speer for her help and input with a meeting
       that was held today regarding a complaint I made about a psychologist I was under. The meeting was a great
       success and the deputy of the mental health team for North Wales and a senior psychologist both apologized
       profusely for the way I was left to feel. I was told by the psychologist I was seeing, that no one on the mental
       health team would work with me because I was too difficult, to which the ladies at the meeting were horrified.
       He also told me that after an afternoon session with me, he often felt like going for a drink. They listened to
       me and are going to take my comments back to the psychologist involved, and have asked me if I am willing for
       them to use my comments in a monthly news letter that goes out to all staff, so that people can learn from my
       experience! I am so happy with the response I had! Thank you for your help!

      <img src="images/sarah.jpg" alt="I met Sandra Speer in November of 2021 during the start of my divorce.
      I found her through one of my domestic abuse groups. She has helped me tremendously through my divorce and
      custody battle. She is also very resourceful when asking about what you should do in a situation especially
      with a narcissist or sociopath. She is very knowledgeable and kind and I believe she really wants to help others.
      I truly believe I wouldn't have gotten as far as I have now without her help.  I truly believe that without her
      help, my 3-year-old son would have been awarded to my sex offending EX.

      <img src="images/bob.jpg" alt="Sandra Speer is possibly the most caring and knowledgeable Legal Advocate I have
      ever met.  My case is 10 years old and she has been the only one to make a difference.  She works non-stop until
      she sees a win for you.

      <img src="images/daniel.jpg" alt="My 6-year-old daughter was awarded to my EX who is an abuser and alcoholic.
      No one believed me when I would say that she beat me and my daughter because I am a big man.  I have to thank
      Sandra for helping me to gain the belief of now the authorities.  I truly believe that it is not going to be long
      before I have custody of my daughter with her assessment showing the abuse that my EX has performed.

      <img src="images/sabrina.jpg" alt="Until my very highly paid attorney read Sandra’s abuse assessment of my case,
      he would not allow me to testify that I was going through a Parental Alienation case.  After reading her assessment,
      my attorney changed his strategy and today I am reunified with my son.  I have never been happier and looking
      forward to many wonderful times with my once alienated son thanks to Sandra’s endless work on my case.

      <img src="images/johnathan.jpg" alt="Sandra Speer you are probably the most valued member of this entire Facebook
      group. So many of us fathers are experiencing this exact same situation. Glad to have you. In California its penal
      code 278.5 I believe and it's a crime to keep the children away from the other parent. The law even says filing
      custody after the fact as a defense is not acceptable for a defense. Or something along those lines. I wish this
      parent, and all parents who need it luck.
