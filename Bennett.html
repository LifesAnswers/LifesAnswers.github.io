<p><strong><h2>Michigan Family Court ignores a child's cry for help</h2></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Two children need your assistance because of being left in danger. The daughter, who is now 7, has for years been crying to her teachers, etc., regarding pain in her vagina, which has been diagnosed as the 
    possible result of sexual child abuse by doctors. The boy, now 10, has been diagnosed with an ongoing discharge. The boy attempted to tell officials of the abuse until he was threatened by police officers 
    that he could go to jail.  Mr. Platte is an Attorney, and his prior representing Attorney was Laurie Marien, who is running for Family Court Judge. Because the children have also been diagnosed as having 
    symptoms of Syphilis and Hepatitis A, there is reason to believe that there is need for forensic exams to rule out sexual child abuse that Mr. Platte and his past attorney, Laurie Marien and present 
    attorney Scott Gaspard are blocking.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    The custody portion of this case is no longer a part of the Court system because Mr. Platte and Ms. Marien successfully misled the Judge into believing that the children are safe due to keeping the evidence 
    out of Court.  Soon after this letter began to circulate, Ms. Marien apparently decided that she no longer wanted to represent Mr. Platte rather than helping the children.  Did she pass the case to Mr. Gaspard 
    due to hide her guilt in harming children to protect her future of becoming a Louisiana Family Court Judge? </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Since the initiation of the case, the father admits to being a sex addict and enjoying porn. At one time, when the suspicion of his guilt was initially raised, his son began to state that his father was 
    encouraging sexual behavior between the two children while touching both his son and daughter.  Ms. Marien allowed law enforcement to frighten the boy with conviction if he continued talking about the sexual 
    abuse his father was and possibly still is inflicting on both he and his sister, which caused the child to fear talking to practitioners. After acquiring written suspicions of sexual abuse on both children 
    from doctor and hospital reports, Ms. Marien blocked the information from the Court. Today, the mother fears being arrested and losing her children if she should ever mention her suspicion of this abuse again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    On August 28, 2023, Ms. Ann K. Gregorie, Executive Director of the Baton Rouge Bar Association referred the case to Office of Disciplinary Counsel stating that, “The correct agency to assist you is the Office 
    of Disciplinary Counsel...”  My experience with communications with State Bar Associations has proven to me that they will not pass a case along to another agency unless they are assured that the organization 
    can work with the individual’s complaint.  In return to the Baton Rouge Bar Association referral, Yolanda Cezar, Screening Counsel for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel stated that the issue was a “...legal 
    dispute that is not within our jurisdiction to resolve.”  I question Ms. Cezar’s answer because the issue is not being handled in Court and questions the ethics of attorneys who hold the power to ruin children’s 
    lives to save their careers.  If the complaint was not within their ability to resolve, the Baton Rouge Bar Association Executive Director would not have sent it to them.  So, again, I ask, why is Ms. Marien 
    being protected over the lives of innocent children?  Is it because she is running for Family Court Judge and knows the right people to keep her possible corruption quiet?  </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    No matter who I ask or how many individuals I seek answers from, they all state that if someone was accusing them of emotionally, physically, and sexually abusing their children, they would offer all information 
    needed to disprove the accusations. Mr. Platte’s daughter is asking her teachers, school nurse, and anyone that she thinks cares to help her because of the constant pain in her vagina. Innocent children should 
    never be left crying in pain when doctors suspect sexual abuse without proper forensic exams. Especially after Syphilis and Hepatitis A have already been suspected in both children. Something is wrong: is someone 
    protecting their career when children’s lives are in question?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    As of their most recent Court appearance in 2023, Ms. Marien threatened the mother with jail time and losing her children if she should continue to talk about the accusations and not pay her fees. Also, as of 2023, 
    Ms. Marien and Mr. Gaspard are still allowing the father to block the mother from acquiring conclusive knowledge with a forensic exam that the sexual abuse is not occurring. For this reason, I suspect that the abuse 
    is continuing. Ms. Marien started the process and has now left the case to Mr. Gaspard because of possibly being worried that if conclusive evidence shows sexual child abuse, the Court would learn that Ms. Marien 
    purposely withheld this information to save her client from being ruled sexually abusing his children. She, Ms. Marien, is running for Family Court Judge in Louisiana. The last thing that the public needs to learn, 
    from her point of view, is that she allowed these children to suffer for years rather than fighting to save them from possible medical neglect and sexual abuse. What is more important, Ms. Marien becoming a Family Court 
    Judge or the safety of these two children?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    I ask that you offer whatever assistance you can to ensure these children are safe. Court rulings regarding the safety of children should not hinge on who is running for political office. If you know of anyone or an 
    agency that can help mentally, physically, and sexually abused children from not falling prey to hidden information regarding their safety, please get in touch with me. I am asking to help cause the father to be forced 
    to allow a forensic exam by the proper doctors to ensure that the children are safe in his presence. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Please help these children and show that you also believe that the safety of children should not be in the hands of individuals with hidden agendas who do not want the truth to surface. These two children could exemplify 
    that Ms. Marien values her career on rulings that fit her agenda, not what is best for the children. Or, if she cannot get away with what is best for her, not the children, she releases herself from the case rather than 
    helping the children.  In my eyes, that does not constitute the ethical behavior of a future Family Court Judge in Louisiana.  Please help these children, and future children, by forcing a proper investigation of this case, 
    and others like it. Children deserve assistance from individuals who value their safety, not just their career motives.</p>
