<p><strong><h2>Texas Tarrant County Family Court Judge admits that there is corruption in the Texas Family Court System! Many children are dying when made victims of this corruption. </h2></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Suppose the mother of your children threatened your oldest child because they told law enforcement of the sexual assault and physical & psychological abuse they were being forced to endure in her custody. 
     Would you seek help from the court system, law enforcement, Child Protective Services (CPS), DA’s office, & local public officials, etc.?
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Since February 27, 2021, Isaiah Lamb, now eight years old, has not been seen by his father, Brad Lamb, after Isaiah & his sister, Aria, made outcries of abuse. These outcries consisted of Isaiah having a 
    black eye & Aria saying that their mother killed their pet cat because they told officials that their mother abuses them. Family Court Services (FCS) terminated Mr. Lamb’s supervised visits the following 
    week, which were the only access he had to his children. By this time, it was the fifth supervisor assigned to this supervisor who witnessed multiple outcries of abuse.   CPS was also notified multiple 
    times regarding the mother’s abuse of the children.   Two of the supervisors have testified in Court of the abuse, including bruises, black eyes, busted lips, & knots on their heads.  FCS disallowed three 
    of the supervisors from testifying, favoring the children in Court, and forbade these supervisors to report anything to CPS. It should be noted that years of outcries of physical, sexual, & psychological 
    abuse by minor children preceded these supervised visits to hospitals, law enforcement, the Crimes Against Children Unit (CACU), family, and friends. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Isaiah has made multiple outcries of sexual assault for himself & his younger sister to Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) at Cook Children’s Hospital, which was coded by admissions as sexual child abuse.  
    Mr. Lamb learned later that each time the child returns to the hospital or any medical establishment, the records of past reports of child sexual abuse are hidden to supposedly protect the child.  The more 
    we communicate with individuals involved with Texas (TX) law enforcement, judicial system, and CPS, the easier it is becoming to understand that hiding a missing child’s abuse could be advantageous for 
    individuals politically involved with the TX Family Court System.  
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    During a conversation with a TX Family Court Judge who was telling us about custody cases they were presiding over to show that they were cleaning up the corruption, I brought up that they had noted quite a 
    few cases, and I was able to find a lot of additional TX Family Court cases that revealed corruption.  When I stated that, “The number of cases that were being found proves the possibility of extreme TX 
    Family Court corruption reveals that there could be a problem in the TX Family Court System.”  This TX Family Court Judge’s response was shocking, “There is not a problem with the TX Family Court System, 
    the problem is that parents are still abusing their children.  And parents do not know how to correctly file for custody modification.”  When Mr. Lamb noted that his attorney’s motions were accepted in 
    the same manner as were the ones he wrote alone, this Family Court Judge was forced to admit that somewhere in the TX Family Court System ignorance on the part of many Judges could be causing wrongful 
    custody rulings.  As I interpreted this conversation, I realized that there is no explanation for where 10% of the number of children missing in the US were going.  
    <a href="https://kfox95.com/texas-children-missing-2023/" style="font-size: 1em">TX is responsible for 10% of the missing children in the US</a>, which does not surprise me because of being on the border 
    to Mexico.  Mexico is highly populated with child trafficking of all sorts, as illustrated in the movie, “Sound of Freedom.”  
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Mr. Lamb has now endured 2 ½ excruciating years of wondering whether his children are alive, beaten, or sexually mutilated with foreign objects.  As if wondering whether his children have been murdered is not 
    bad enough, Mr. Lamb is now also painfully asking if his children have become a part of a profitable adoption system in TX or sold to the first buyer for human trafficking.  In spite of all this, Isaiah and 
    Aria, who was two years old at the time of the first report of her being beaten and raped in her mother’s home, were heartlessly ruled by Judge Judith Wells (judge on this case for over seven years) to return 
    to the mother who disappeared with the children. Judge Wells chose to retire rather than go to jail for her corruption in the Tarrant County Family Court system that caused many wrong custody rulings. Isaiah’s 
    outcries were ignored in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, TX, by Judge Wells, the Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD), CACU, the DA’s office, the sheriff’s department, FCS, the TX Department of Children and Families 
    (TDCF), State Representatives, and various agencies provided by the TX Government to supposedly assist abused children.  
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Suspended Attorney General Paxton’s aid recommended I call Mr. Lamb’s State Representative.  When I spoke with Representative Turner’s aid, she laughingly stated in response to my question of where these children
     are going, “The TX government would look odd to someone from outside of the TX system.”  As I was ending the conversation, I asked again if the children could be assisted when I was told by the TX State 
     Representative Turner’s aid that, “No, (she answered adamantly) no state Representative that she knows of in the state of TX is going help those kids.”  I had to wonder if she was aware of the case prior to my 
     call because Mr. Lamb has not been quiet regarding his questioning of the whereabouts of his children.   
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/child-abuse/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370867" style="font-size: 1em">Child abuse researchers recommend</a> that if young children, especially those under 
    the age of 10, act out or talk of abuse or sex acts, they should be listened to because they would not be exposed to these issues unless they were happening.  These two children talked of objects being inserted in 
    their anus and vagina, raped, and beaten, as noted in many forensic interviews with both children.  In response, Judge Wells of Tarrant County, TX ruled these minor victims to their possible death; she sent them to 
    live with their abusers, Mother, and Half-brother.   <a href="https://pissedoffparent.com/judge-judith-wells/" style="font-size: 1em">Judge Wells</a> was known to possibly profit from these wrong rulings but was never 
    punished in the State of Texas.  She was applauded because some of the money may have conveniently leaked back into the TX Government.  
    <a href="https://www.fwweekly.com/2022/02/09/50-shades-of-public-corruption/" style="font-size: 1em">The Fort Worth Weekly</a> noted on February 9, 2022, that “Judges aren’t the only elected officials (in Tarrant 
    County, TX) who have no problem tying our criminal justice system to known racists.” 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;"></p><strong>“Officeholders in TX, much more so than in most states, apparently believe that corruption is the primary privilege of office holding” (Floyd, 2021).</strong>
</p>
<p style="width: 80%; text-indent: 30px;">
    Mr. Floyd, in his report regarding the corrupt TX government in 2021, also states that: <br><br> 
    “… TX is an insanely terrible place to do business: It has corrupt public officials — law-enforcement officers on the cartel dime, judges selling verdicts, members of a drug task force shepherding contraband from Mexico, 
    school-board races in which cash and cocaine are traded for votes…(Floyd, 2021). 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    No wonder approximately 10% of the abused and missing children in the US come from TX.  The Reform Austin Article stated that the FBI office located in San Antonio reported that corruption investigations tripled 
    by 2014 in TX and are continuing to climb as a result from being ignored by TX Law Enforcement, Politicians, various organizations, etc. Minors are dying under the TX government’s see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no 
    evil approach to assisting abused and missing children.   
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Seeking assistance for an abused or missing child in TX is almost impossible to acquire.  Possibly your only hope of seeing your child again is if you have enough money to fund a political campaign.  That is if he or she h
    as not been sold for adoption or human trafficking.  Of course, you cannot put a price tag on life, or can you?  The National Office of Adoptions (NOA) notes that TX adoptions are among the most expensive in the Country, 
    “... the average private adoption in TX can cost between <a href="https://www.bryanfagan.com/blog/2018/april/how-much-does-it-cost-to-adopt-a-child-in-texas-/" style="font-size: 1em">$60,000 and $65,000</a>.”  If you choose 
    a state adoption, your cost can range between <a href="https://www.americanadoptionsoftexas.com/adopt/adoption-costs-TX" style="font-size: 1em">$5,000.00 to $10,000.00</a>.  Where is this money going?  The families in TX are not 
    profiting from an improved system.  The number of abused and missing children being ignored by officials in TX is climbing every year.  I guess TX is proud to be one of the worst states in the US to bring up a family.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    The child of 4 years old, Isaiah Lamb, as noted by the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) from Cook Children’s Hospital in 2019 that was being abused:
</p>
<p style="width: 80%; text-indent: 30px;">
    Isaiah is a very cute four-year-old boy that knows his letters and colors.  He’s able to identify all body parts. …  When asked if anyone has ever touched the areas where no one is supposed to touch. … He’s mean (half-brother 
    aged 16 or 17) and hurts me.  He hits me and kicks me.  He touches my pee pee and butt. … under my clothes. … I don’t like my mommy’s house. … Mommy touch my pee pee and bobo. … She (Mother) hits me on my face with a wooden 
    spoon. … A lot of times. … At Mom’s he (half-brother) did like Mommy every time. He put his pee pee in my bobo. Then he screams in my ear.… They (Mother & half-brother) They started to cut his (guinea pig) … She (mother) went 
    back to look (the guinea pig), and all four legs were cut off. Mommy was cleaning up the guinea pig and threw him in the trash. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    The last time the father saw Isaiah & Aria was on 2/27/21, when both children made outcries of abuse. The last pictures Mr. Lamb has of the children were taken by Sgt. DeHoyas with CACU on 8/5/21. Sgt. DeHoyas sent pictures 
    from her bodycam footage that clearly showed both eyes being black on the children. The officer left the children with the mother per Judge Wells’ ruling. Aria, his sister, has only been seen once while moving with their mother, 
    but Isaiah was not seen. This is the last time anyone has seen Isaiah or Aria alive. Carist Washington has kidnapped these children with the blessings of Tarrant County law enforcement, politicians, Judge Wells, etc.   
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    TX Law Enforcement, Politicians, organizations, etc., deny these minor children assistance, as noted below: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>June 28, 2019, we picked up the kids from Carist.  Upon arrival at home, Isaiah cried for help announcing that he was being hit, sucked, sodomized, and his sister was being raped.</li>
    <li>On July 1, the acts were reported to the Women’s Center.  After the Women’s Center we then made contact with the Alliance for Children (AFC), the Alliance contacted CPS.  When we waited at the AFC office, the front desk 
        operator reported that CPS told them that the case was closed, and we were ordered to leave.</li>
    <li>Then, we contacted FWPD.</li>
    <li>Officer Hughes and Lanier, to whom we reported the incidences of abuse, escorted us to Cook Children’s Hospital to acquire a forensic exam by a SANE nurse, which was quoted previously in this letter.</li>
    <li>Days later, the father was contacted by Detective Rodriguez, who told him to return to the AFC for another forensic exam.  When he asked Detective Rodriguez if Isaiah had made an outcry, he replied, “You would not be 
        sitting here if he didn’t.  We would have asked you to leave.”</li>
    <li>After that interview, no one, including CPS, would communicate with the father until days later when Detective Rodriguez called at 5 PM stating that Judge Wells ordered the children to return to Carist at 6 PM.  He 
        stated that only Judge Wells could amend that order, which she denied, forcing the children back to their mother’s abusive home.  She also placed a restraining order against the children, barring Mr. Lamb from having 
        any contact with his children.  Why was it important to restrain the father from contact with his children?</li>
    <li>On July 12, Isaiah disclosed that he had been raped numerous times since the father last saw him.  He also stated that his mother and half-brother warned him not to talk to teachers or the police anymore because what 
        they were doing was naughty and that Isaiah would be the one to get into trouble.</li>
    <li>That week the father exhausted all officials and organizations he could find to file complaints of the mishandling of his case, he contacted Detective Rodriguez’s superior and Sgt. Dehoyas, etc., That communication resulted in no return call until weeks later when it was reported that the issue was between Brad and CPS.  Fort Worth, Tarrant County law enforcement and Judge Wells declared that the children were to be in the care of their mother until CPS reported abuse.  CPS found all accusations of abuse unfounded, which fed the Court with what they wanted to hear to keep whatever corruption continuing.  Where are these children today?  Is Isaiah alive?  Could these children have been sold in the TX adoption system or become part of the human trafficking rings that fund many of TX and US politicians?</li>
    <li>All recusals against Judge Wells from Brad were denied.  The day before the third recusal request was to be heard, the father was wrongfully arrested by a fully armed fugitive task force from his home.  This resulted in the father missing the hearing for the third recusal, which was also denied because he was held for 48 hours eliminating his ability to testify.</li>
    <li>Five supervisors of the visitation between the children and the father noted that the children were being physically abused.  When a supervisor reported the abuse, they were fired from the case.  Again, why was the abuse of these minor children hidden?  Who could have profited?</li>
    <li>FWPD installed a surveillance camera on a light post by the father’s home, and it was   up five months, along with a 24/7 police watch. How many tax dollars did this cost? What is Tarrant Co protecting?</li>
    <li>The father contacted FWPD multiple times until he was threatened with arrest for making too many reports.  Why would any authority say this to a parent looking for help for their innocent children being sexually abused?</li>
    <li>In June 2023, Mr. Lamb is still learning that the TX Attorney General (AG), DA, State Representatives, Government funded organizations, CPS, and the Governor of TX refuse to assist with helping find his children.  It is being reported to the father that there is no record of the case.  Still, the question is why?  Why are abused and missing children ignored in TX?</li>
    <li><strong>On June 23, 2023, Crystal Jones, CPS Investigative Supervisor II (817-565-3083) stated to the Stepmother that the children were not missing, and the state knows where they are.   Yet, she would not share their whereabouts with their biological father, who the mentioned above TX Family Court Judge stated that he had all parental rights to this information.  Could some agency, or government body, be profiting from keeping the whereabouts of missing children in Texas a secret?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    Since the last time Brad saw his children, 2/27/21, he and his wife have pleaded for the assistance of law enforcement, the military (Carist is still a part of the Air Force), the FBI, and any other local or federal entity 
    they could find.  Why is it that no one wants to touch this case?  Is it because Fort Worth and Tarrant County represent the children who may be being     forced to endure horrendous maltreatment while being groomed for 
    expensive adoptions and human trafficking that funds many political careers?  What is happening in our backyards because thousands of children per year disappear mysteriously, resulting from corrupt family court rulings in 
    the US, with TX responsible for approximately 10% of those exploited children?
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    Where are your children?  Is anyone threatening their lives?  You better hope not because they are often sold in adoptions or bought for human trafficking.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    Mr. Lamb is asking that anyone or organizations with the means to assist in finding his missing children offer an honest hand in the investigation.  He hopes to find his children before their abuser murders them.  Please 
    ensure that what is best for these children occurs.
